# Quick start

Welcome to **BrewBook** ‚Äî your caf√©‚Äôs one-stop contact manager for customers, staff, and suppliers.  
Follow these simple steps to get started ‚Äî no technical experience needed!

---

## Step 1: Check that Java 17 is installed

BrewBook requires **Java 17** to run.  
Let‚Äôs check whether it‚Äôs already installed on your computer.

- **On Windows**
  1. Click the **Start Menu**, type `cmd`, and open **Command Prompt**.
  2. In the black window, type: `java -version`
  3. Press **Enter**.
- If you see something like:
  ```
  java version "17.0.10"
  ```
  ‚úÖ Great! You already have Java 17 installed.
- If you see an older version (e.g. ‚Äú11‚Äù or ‚Äú8‚Äù) or an error saying **‚Äújava is not recognized‚Äù**, you‚Äôll need to install Java 17.

üëâ **To install Java 17:**  
Visit the official Java 17 download page [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html).

Download the **Windows x64 Installer (JDK 17)** and follow the instructions on screen.  
When done, repeat the steps above to confirm it says **version 17**.

- **On Mac**

  1. Open **Terminal** (press **Command + Space**, type `Terminal`, and press **Enter**).
  2. Type: `java -version`
  3. Press **Enter**.
- If it shows something like `"17.0.x"`, ‚úÖ you‚Äôre ready!
- If it says **‚Äúcommand not found‚Äù** or shows an older version, install Java 17.

üëâ **To install Java 17 on macOS:**  
Go to [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html)  
Download the **macOS Installer (JDK 17)** and follow the setup instructions.  
After installation, open Terminal again and run `java -version` to confirm it now shows version 17.

---

## Step 2: Download BrewBook

1. Go to the [BrewBook releases page](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/releases).
2. Look for the latest version and click to download the file named **`BrewBook.jar`**.  
   (Think of this as your ‚ÄúBrewBook app.‚Äù)

---

## Step 3: Set up your BrewBook folder

1. Create a new folder anywhere you like ‚Äî for example:
   - **Windows:** `C:\Users\Jean\Documents\BrewBook`
   - **macOS:** `/Users/Jean/Documents/BrewBook` or `~/Documents/BrewBook`
   - **Linux:** `/home/jean/Documents/BrewBook`
2. Move the downloaded **`BrewBook.jar`** file into that folder.  
      BrewBook will automatically save your data there each time you use it.

---

## Step 4: Open BrewBook

1. Find the **`BrewBook.jar`** file you downloaded.
2. **Double-click** it to open BrewBook.
3. Wait a few seconds ‚Äî the main screen will appear with some sample contacts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
<!--
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.-->

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</div>



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
